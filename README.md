## Getting Started
### These instruction will help you setup a local development instance of the app.

Install dependencies
```bash
cd client/
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

Setup prerequisites

For an example how to fill .env.local  see .env.example

To get the variables for .env.local you will need to create a new free account with [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)


Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


The backend code for this project can be found at [ca-backend](https://github.com/MohammedAK1991/ca-backend)

#### Things i would improve
- Make the UI fully responsive
- Compose the project in docker (Its harder with the new M1 macbook pro)
